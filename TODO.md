- write tests in this order:

    1. Packet
    1. NetReader
    1. Crypto
    1. Sender
    1. Channel
    1. Session

- In SSH/Internal/Util.hs, fromOctet and toOctet take a base argument, but
  everywhere they are used, it is just being passed as 256, so really we
  should just hard-code 256 into the method.
